# Kone: Polynomial

This module extends [module "algebraic"](/docs/kone-main/algebraic) and provides the basic concept of working with univariate and multivariate polynomials and rational functions over any specified ring in so-called polynomial and rational functions spaces and their implementations.

## Applying the dependencies

<DependencyTabs artifact="kone.polynomial"/>

## Concept

Let us remind common terms and introduce Kone-specific ones:
- *Free variable* or *indeterminate* is just a formal symbol. Like $x$, $y$, $z$, $n$, $m$, $\alpha$, $\zeta$, etc. In Kone variable can be described as absolutely arbitrary string (because they are represented as KMath's `Symbol` instances).
- *Monomial* or *term of polynomial* (over a ring $R$) is a formal finite (associative commutative) product of an element of $R$ and free variables. If used variables are $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$, then monomial is usually represented as a product $a \; x_1^{d_1} x_2^{d_2} \dots x_n^{d_n}$ for some natural $d_i$. $a$ is called a *coefficient* of the monomial and mapping $\{x_1 \to d_1, \dots, x_n \to d_n\}$ is called *signature* of the monomial.
- *Polynomial* (over a ring $R$) is a formal finite (associative commutative) sum of monomials.
- If a polynomial does not involve any variable (it is equal to an element of the ring $R$), it is called *constant*. If it involves a single variable, it is called *univariate*. If it involves several variables, it is called *multivariate*.
- Polynomials of variables $x_1$, ..., $x_n$ over ring $R$ form a ring that is called *polynomial space* over $R$ and is denoted as $R[x_1, \dots, x_n]$.
- Given a total order on signatures, term with the greatest signature is called a *leading term* of the polynomial, its coefficient is called a *leading coefficient* of the polynomial, and its signature is called a *leading signature* of the polynomial.

### Polynomial spaces interfaces

In a polynomial space over ring `R` we specify algebraic operations on polynomials, and algebraic operations on polynomials and constants. Basically, the polynomial main interfaces look like this (see API reference for <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-polynomial-space/index.html'>`PolynomialSpace`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-multivariate-polynomial-space/index.html'>`MultivariatePolynomialSpace`</ApiLink>):
```
// A bit simplified. See full API in API reference.

context(A)
public interface PolynomialSpace<C, P, out A: Ring<C>> : Ring<P> {
    // Constants of the space
    public val constantZero: C
    public val constantOne: C
    public val polynomialZero: C
    public val polynomialOne: C

    // Equality tests.
    public override infix fun P.equalsTo(other: P): Boolean = this == other

    // Conversions
    public fun constantValueOf(value: Int): C
    public override fun valueOf(value: Int): P
    public fun valueOf(value: C): P

    // Operations on constants with polynomials
    public operator fun P.plus(other: Int): P
    public operator fun P.minus(other: Int): P
    public operator fun P.times(other: Int): P

    public operator fun P.plus(other: C): P
    public operator fun P.minus(other: C): P
    public operator fun P.times(other: C): P

    ...

    // Operations on polynomials
    public override operator fun P.unaryPlus(): P = this
    public override operator fun P.unaryMinus(): P
    public override operator fun P.plus(other: P): P
    public override operator fun P.minus(other: P): P
    public override operator fun P.times(other: P): P

    // Polynomial properties
    public val P.degree: Int
}


context(A)
public interface MultivariatePolynomialSpace<C, V, P, out A: Ring<C>>: PolynomialSpace<C, P, A> {
    // Convertions on variables
    public fun valueOf(variable: V): P

    // Algebraic operations involving variable.
    public operator fun V.plus(other: Int): P
    public operator fun V.minus(other: Int): P
    public operator fun V.times(other: Int): P

    public operator fun V.plus(other: C): P
    public operator fun V.minus(other: C): P
    public operator fun V.times(other: C): P

    public operator fun V.plus(other: P): P
    public operator fun V.minus(other: P): P
    public operator fun V.times(other: P): P

    public operator fun V.unaryPlus(): P
    public operator fun V.unaryMinus(): P
    public operator fun V.plus(other: V): P
    public operator fun V.minus(other: V): P
    public operator fun V.times(other: V): P

    ...

    // Properties of multivariate polynomials.
    public val P.degrees: Map<V, UInt>
    public fun P.degreeBy(variable: V): UInt
    public fun P.degreeBy(variables: Collection<V>): UInt
    public val P.variables: Set<V>
    public val P.countOfVariables: Int
}
```

There are also division operations in case of a field `R`. See <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-polynomial-space-over-field/index.html'>`PolynomialSpaceOverField`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-multivariate-polynomial-space-over-field/index.html'>`MultivariatePolynomialSpaceOverField`</ApiLink>

### Implementations of polynomial spaces

In Kone, there are two types of polynomial representation:
1. One can represent a univariate polynomial $a_0 + \dots + a_n x^n$ as a list $[a_0, \dots, a_n]$. <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-list-polynomial/index.html'>`ListPolynomial`</ApiLink> implements this behaviour.
2. One can represent a multivariate polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i x_1^{d_{1, i}} \dots x_k^{d_{k, i}}$ as a map $\{s_1 \to a_1, \dots, s_n \to a_n\}$ where each $s_i$ is a signature of $a_i x_1^{d_{1, i}} \dots x_k^{d_{k, i}}$ and is represented as a map $\{x_1 \to d_{1, i}, \dots, x_k \to d_{k, i}\}$. <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-labeled-polynomial/index.html'>`LabelledPolynomial`</ApiLink> implements this behaviour.

:::caution
`NumberedPolynomial` implementation is deprecated and is going to be removed soon.

Both types of polynomials have associated polynomial spaces (<ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-list-polynomial-space/index.html'>`ListPolynomialSpace`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-labeled-polynomial-space/index.html'>`LabelledPolynomial`</ApiLink>) that are constructed on provided ring.

### Rational functions spaces interfaces

In a rational functions space over ring `R` we specify algebraic operations on constants, polynomials, (variables,) and rational functions. Basically, the polynomial main interfaces look like this (see API reference for <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-rational-function-space/index.html'>`RationalFunctionSpace`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-rational-function-space-over-field/index.html'>`RationalFunctionSpaceOverField`</ApiLink>):

    public val polynomialOne: P get() = polynomialSpace.run { one }

    // Equality tests
    public override infix fun RF.equalsTo(other: RF): Boolean

    // Convertions

    public override fun valueOf(value: Int): RF
    public fun polynomialValueOf(value: C): P
    public fun valueOf(value: C): RF = valueOf(polynomialValueOf(value))
    public fun valueOf(value: P): RF = one * value

    // Operations on RFs and others

}
```

### Implementations of rational functions spaces

In Kone, there are two types of rational functions: <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-list-rational-function/index.html'>`ListRationalFunction`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-labeled-rational-function/index.html'>`LabeledRationalFunction`</ApiLink>. They both are just represented as fractions of corresponding polynomial types. Both types of rational functions have associated spaces (<ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-list-rational-function-space/index.html'>`ListRationalFunctionSpace`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to='libs/main/polynomial/com.lounres.kone.polynomial/-labeled-rational-function-space/index.html'>`LabeledRationalFunctionSpace`</ApiLink>) that are constructed on provided ring.
