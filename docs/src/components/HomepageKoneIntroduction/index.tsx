                            All common math libraries built in modern programming languages are made for programmers,
                            data scientists, and any other business-driven direction. And there is no fixture to,
                            for example, play with polynomials and Bernoulli number, compute properties of geometric
                            construction, or brute-force some combinatorial problem. This library tries to fix it!

                            Why Kotlin?
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            There are several advantages from programming on Kotlin:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Kotlin supports JVM, JS, and Native platforms. JVM is already very comfortable to
                                    use, but you also have ability to move you application computation to web and native
                                    environment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Kotlin is very idiomatic. At first glimpse it's very simple, but it also has a lot of
                                    interesting complex syntax features that allows you to write very understandable and
                                    hard-to-brake code (if you use it right ðŸ˜‰).
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
    );
