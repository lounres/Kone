Hi! I'm Gleb.
I'm bachelor math student at SPbU in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
And I introduce you Kone, a library that helps you do math experiments with more ease.

# Why did I create this library?

Since I was in 8th grade of school I loved to do math.
And sometimes I unconsciously experimented by calculating a number of the first elements of different series.
For example, the most standard problem is to found out that sum $1^k + 2^k + \dots + n^k$ for some fixed $k$ is actually
a polynomial of $n$ (of degree $k+1$).
And there is a lot of interesting theory around the problem.
So sometimes I was so impatient that I calculated the first several polynomials.
But it was such a hassle to calculate them by hand. And it still is ðŸ˜‰.
The calculations were very simple to describe but very hard to calculate manually without mistakes.
So I created a small library in Python that helped me with such a hassle.
After that the library was growing because of new computational problems.
And at some point it was rewritten in Kotlin.
But it looked like hell full of non-reusable scripts of an amateur programmer
that I rewrote it in Kotlin one more time from a scratch but now on a clean architecture.
Also, around this time I've got to know KMath and its authors.
So I mimicked KMath in some architectural questions.
And using prototype of my new library I even contributed in KMath about 37K strings of code ðŸ˜….
