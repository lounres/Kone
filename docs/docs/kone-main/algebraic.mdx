# Kone: Algebraic

This package describes the basic concept of working with algebraic structures and its implementation.

## Applying the dependencies

<DependencyTabs artifact="kone-algebraic"/>

## Concept

Do you remember what is [*ring in algebra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)#Definition)? It's a tuple $\langle R; +^2, -^1, \cdot^2; 0, 1)$ satisfying ring axioms. In detail, it's
1. some set $R$, which elements we call "elements" or "numbers" of the ring, and we work with,
2. binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$ on $R$ that we call "addition" and "multiplication" respectively,
3. unary operation $-$ on $R$ that we call "additive inversion" or "getting opposite element", and
4. constants $0$ and $1$ from $R$ that we call "additive identity" and "multiplicative identity" respectively or "zero" and "unit" respectively

that satisfies some axioms that [you can find in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)#Definition). But note that in real life we also always use "subtraction" operation. But if you think about more programmatic approach then you'll find out you forgot to name equality predicate, and also you will need conversion of integers to your ring elements and also duplications of algebraic operations with some parameters substituted with integers.

<!-- TODO: hyperlink to API -->
So in Kone any ring is implemented as an object that holds all the operation of the ring, so it can be used as an algebraic context. For example, there `kone-numberTheory` provides class of Rational numbers and field context for them:
```
// Simplified definition. See actual API in API reference
data class Rational(val numerator: Long, val denumerator: Long)

public object RationalField : Field<Rational> /* Field is an extension interface of Ring */ {
    // Constants of the field
    public override val zero: Rational = Rational(0L)
    public override val one: Rational = Rational(1L)

    // The context's equality checkers
    public override infix fun Rational.equalsTo(other: Rational): Boolean = this == other
    public override fun Rational.isZero(): Boolean = numerator == 0L
    public override fun Rational.isOne(): Boolean = numerator == 1L && denominator == 1L

    // Integers conversion
    public override fun valueOf(arg: Int): Rational = Rational(arg.toLong())
    public override fun valueOf(arg: Long): Rational = Rational(arg)

    // Main algebraic operations of the ring
    public override operator fun Rational.unaryMinus(): Rational = ...
    public override operator fun Rational.plus(other: Rational): Rational = ...
    public override operator fun Rational.minus(other: Rational): Rational = ...
    public override operator fun Rational.times(other: Rational): Rational = ...
    // It's an operation from Field interface
    public override operator fun Rational.div(other: Rational): Rational = ...

    // And copies of the operation with the second argument as Int
    public override operator fun Rational.plus(other: Int): Rational = ...
    public override operator fun Rational.minus(other: Int): Rational = ...
    public override operator fun Rational.times(other: Int): Rational = ...
    // It's an operation from Field interface
    public override operator fun Rational.div(other: Int): Rational = ...

    // There are also similar operations but with Long instead of Int and/or
    // the first argument to be substituted instead of the first

    // Also some operations comes from Ring/Field interface as derived from the operations above
}
```

## Examples
Here is an example of standard way to use context of rational numbers:
<!-- TODO: examples for signed integer power -->
```kotlin showLineNumbers
import com.lounres.kone.algebraic.*
import com.lounres.kone.numberTheory.*

// highlight-start
Rational.field /* It's another reference to RationalField */ {
    val a = Rational(1, 2)
    val b = Rational(1, 3)

    // Operations with Rationals
    println(+a)
//  >>> 1/2
    println(-b)
//  >>> -1/3
    println(a + b)
//  >>> 5/6
    println(a - b)
//  >>> 1/6
    println(a * b)
//  >>> 1/6
    println(a / b)
//  >>> 3/2

    // Operations with Rationals and integers
    println(b - 1)
//  >>> -2/3
    println(34 * a)
//  >>> 17

    // Operations with only integers are not supported! Kotlin built-in operations are used
    println((5 * 7)::class.simpleName)
//  >>> Int

    // Context equality checkers does not support default Kotlin `equals` operator.
    // Instead, there are `equalsTo`, `notEqualsTo`, `eq`, `neq` infix operations.
    println(a equalsTo b)
//  >>> false
    println(a * 2 eq b * 3)
//  >>> true
    println(a * b neq b * a)
//  >>> false

    // Also, there are other equality checkers and operations defined in Ring and Field interfaces.
    // See API reference for the details.
}
// highlight-end

// highlight-start
// Contexts can also be used to return result of computation inside them
fun bernoulliNumber(n: Int): Rational = Rational.field {
    // Initialise a list for storing the recursively computed Bernoulli numbers
    val bernoulliNumbers = Array<Rational?>(n + 1) { null }
    bernoulliNumbers[0] = one

    // Compute the numbers with recurrent formula
    for (i in 1..n) bernoulliNumbers[i] =
        (1..i)
            .map { k -> binomial(i + 1, k + 1) * bernoulliNumbers[i - k]!! }
            .reduce { acc, r -> acc + r } / -(i + 1)

    // Return result
    bernoulliNumbers[n]!!
}
println(bernoulliNumber(14))
// >>> 7/6
// highlight-end
```
