# Intro

Kone is divided to modules by purpose. There is no module you need by default. Each module describes its tools and concepts to solve some atomic problem. So you can plug in necessary modules one by one to collect your one puzzle.

All the modules are available on Maven Central as artifact of the same name as the project in group `com.lounres.kone`. For example, you can add `kone-algebraic` module to your `kotlin` dependencies like

<DependenciesTabs artifact="kone-algebraic"/>

Further, you will find description of each module.
