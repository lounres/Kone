I\'m Gleb.\\nI\'m undergraduate math student at SPbU in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\\nAnd I introduce you Kone, a library that helps you do math experiments with more ease.\\n\\n# Why did I create this library?\\n\\nSince I was in 8th grade of school I loved to do math.\\nAnd sometimes I unconsciously experimented by calculating a number of the first elements of different series.\\nFor example, the most standard problem is to found out that sum $1^k + 2^k + \\\\dots + n^k$ for some fixed $k$ is actually\\na polynomial of $n$ (of degree $k+1$).\\nAnd there is a lot of interesting theory around the problem.\\nSo sometimes I was so impatient that I calculated the first several polynomials.\\nBut it was such a hassle to calculate them by hand. And it still is \ud83d\ude09.\\nThe calculations were very simple to describe but very hard to calculate manually without mistakes.\\nSo I created a small library in Python that helped me with such a hassle.\\nAfter that the library was growing because of new computational problems.\\nAnd at some point it was rewritten in Kotlin.\\nBut it looked like hell full of non-reusable scripts of an amateur programmer\\nthat I rewrote it in Kotlin one more time from a scratch but now on a clean architecture.\\nAlso, around this time I\'ve got to know KMath and its authors.\\nSo I mimicked KMath in some architectural questions.\\nAnd using prototype of my new library I even contributed in KMath about 37K strings of code \ud83d\ude05."}]}')}}]);
